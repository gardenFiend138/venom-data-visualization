# Venom Analysis: LD50, Invenomation Effects, & Uses in Medicine

## Background and Overview
I have always been fascinated by reptiles; in addition to keeping and breeding snakes, I have attended international symposiums dedicated to furthering the study of reptiles, and over the past few years have taken an interest in the emerging medical research concerning the use of venom in medicine, particularly in pain management and cancer treatments. 

These data visualizations re represented by a bubble chart, and will correlate:
* LD-50 of venoms
* Uses in Medicine 
* Classification of venom type 
  * Mytotoxin
  * Neurotoxin
  * Haemotoxin
  * Necrotoxin
  * Cytotoxin
* Effects of Envenomation 
* Bites/ deaths per year 
* Proteins Present 


## Functionality and MVP
Users will be able to view a bubble map, with each circle representing an individual venomous species. 
* The circle size will correlate to the LD-50 of the venom, and the location of the circle will correspond to the animal's geographic range. 
* The color of each circle will be determined by the classification of the venom type. 
* Users will be able to hover over each circle, and it will expand to reveal more information about each species, including: scientific and common names, the effects of envenomation, and bites/ deaths per year. 
* If the venom is being researched for medical use, the circle will ___________ .
