# Venom Analysis: LD50, Invenomation Effects, & Uses in Medicine

## Background and Overview
I have always been fascinated by reptiles; in addition to keeping and breeding snakes, I have attended international symposiums dedicated to furthering the study of reptiles, and over the past few years have taken an interest in the emerging medical research concerning the use of venom in medicine, particularly in pain management and cancer treatments. 

These data visualizations re represented by a bubble chart, and will correlate:
* LD-50 of venoms
* Proteins Present 
* Effects of Invenomation 
* Uses in Medicine 
* Classification of venom type 
  * Mytotoxin
  * Neurotoxin
  * Haemotoxin
  * Necrotoxin
  * Cytotoxin
* Bites/ deaths per year
